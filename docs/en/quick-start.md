# Quick Start

1. Install via composer and run dev/build OR just simply download and place into the project.

2. Add the following configuration code to your "mysite/_config.php" file. (For SilverStripe 4 projects, just create a "mysite/_config.php" file and ignore it in your .gitignore)
```php
<?php

SilbinaryWolf\Ralph\Ralph::enable();
```

3. Scroll to the bottom of any non-CMS page and view the profiling results at the bottom of the page:
